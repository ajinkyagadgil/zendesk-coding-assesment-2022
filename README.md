- Created API using flask to fetch the tickets and UI using Angular 10
- The backend project is flask project. I have used python 3.8 
- The folder has requirements.txt which would install all the required packages. 
- run command pip install -r requirements.txt from backend folder to install dependencies.
- It has config.json file which has the base url, username and password which can be configured.
- Run the backend using python backend.py command.
- The UI code is written in angular 10. Open the code and run npm install to install all the required package.
- Then run npm start command to run the angular code.
- In assets folder there is config.json from where the API url could be changed.
- After running the command it would display the tickets with default page size of 25.
- When click on the row or on details button dialog would open showing more details of the ticket.
